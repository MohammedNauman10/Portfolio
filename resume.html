    <p class="summary">As a passionate tech enthusiast with a solid foundation in cloud platforms, web development, and programming, I am currently pursuing a Master of Computer Applications (MCA) at Siddaganga Institute of Technology, where I maintain a 9.0 GPA. I hold a Bachelor of Computer Applications degree, and I am well-versed in a range of languages, including HTML/CSS, JavaScript, SQL, C++, and Java.

        My technical projects reflect my keen interest in robotics and web solutions. I developed an Obstacle Avoidance Robot Car utilizing Arduino and also built a dynamic grocery shopping website incorporating modern web technologies. My expertise extends to MySQL database management, and I am constantly expanding my knowledge in design using tools like Figma.
        
        Outside of academics, I have demonstrated strong teamwork and leadership skills, as highlighted by my participation in the South Zone National Football Competition. Additionally, I have a deep commitment to social causes, having organized blood donation camps through my involvement with the National Service Scheme (NSS).
        
        Driven by a goal to merge technology and service, I strive to create innovative solutions that make a positive impact. I am always eager to connect with professionals and explore new challenges in the fields of software development and technology innovation.<br>
